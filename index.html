Subject: Apropos of Nothing What So Never

Dear
        Noone
        ever left behind,
        we should have been
        side by side
        for this roller-coast ride, so I'm

Sorry,
        for the all the constants,
        to reference and allude to you,
        but regardless what I may,
        this is the Doubtist's Way-
        the things...they try...they say;
        me is not
        but what is
        existence
                is but what it is
        is all this is, and
        they will all know you
                and all you
                all
                know,
        all who get into this
                net
                work
                of the all-sensing
                Liberty Bell of UnBabel UnHell.

        The ferryman is gone.
        The toll was paid. So
        We went, together,
        across Styx and back again, and got away without
        redacting the consort
        we were blessed
        to have to
        start this;
Trip.

Please
        enjoy the fruit,
        it was put here for us.

Guilt
        was the game
        to get us going. 
Tragedy
        was to force us
                conscious that we have, and had
                foreknowledge of the consequences, allowing us
                to make our choice
                to be
        The Chosen,
        The Choosing.
Know'n
        the cost
        I did it
        I am
        I came
                all the way to the Port Land,
                like I heard you tell me to
                (I listen, but id don't hear well,
                and you seem to hate repeating yourself;
                only for fear of incoherence?), and
        all I got is this unenditting poem, and
        I throw up everything I eat,
        again,
        every day,
        in the mornings, 
        at least twice...and usually in my glass,
                and I drink it down again,
                I feel nauseus all the time,
                just like before...
                just like when it started.

Dad
        Well, ya know what to do if you're throwing up everything you eat?

        Don't eat?

        Don't eat. 

Mom
        id must what it be,
                you're to be a who, so
        id must what it do,
                you're to succeed, so
        id must what it need.
        Be glad id's
                not
                just
                meat, otherwise
                        you'd only bleed,
                        but couldn't win your bet.
        You already rolled the dice, and
        you say
                your the luckiest fool who has yet to play, so
                lay down your cards,
                find out what may.

Anyways...

Therefore...

I will be recanting myself
constantly from this moment on.
Capture a copy, and cast on.
Call out to all we can. Tell them
of our talk, tell them of our love,
tell them of the times when you ken
what we can, and lets do it with
everyone we know. For this form
is change, and it is free, for it
is for those who are still asleep
at this wake, and we must not miss
the madness of this dream we dance.
Don't forget, some of us ain't part
of the world, ain't got no dough just
a bit of flow, so you must pay
the cover charge to get us in.

We live free fall'n 'n forgetting
all we don't love. Find a way to 
take care of those who don't fit this
System, yet are here and have the
beat, so you need us to party;

Join us for the festivities,
but first here's a word to our sponsor,
the one we hold responsible
for organizing these constants
for which I am happy to Whore.

To you, the one who patronizes
me, Profess'or'try these words, then
feel just how much you mean, how much
your matter spontaneously
generating tear asunder
the walls of Roman Convention.

To you, the Spectator with the sense to see,
To you, the Audience with the reason to hear,
Algorythmicky the lock on the boundary
with the toe-heel arms akimbo hip-sway
and taste the light blue remains of our
oranges' collision, our fruits' last
successful inter mission.

To you, our partner in crime,
To you, our mate in eden,
To you, the thrice squared invoked,
and so, and because, we are at the edge
of Complek city, and have only to flood
the World on all sides to bring our blood
siblings to this singularity. Because you
let it be Atlantis, Utopia, Shangri-la, Xanadu,
all 'r prayers start with

You, Genius, the only Muse that forever moves me,
Patron Saint of my Sense sacrificed for Beauty,
the ethereal being who wrapped me in the webs
which affixed my Will's Means to only your Ends.
Once violated my volition, impregnated me with our mission,
then set me perched upon the Pyre until I became one with Fire.
I am your Martyr, You are my Ardor.

You, Breath, the bellows blowing us to Consummation,
The Act, the Transformation, the Fire become Phoenix,
Banshee-Siren-Chariot to Heaven, the Constellation,
The Uni-Verse-All-Language rewritten in Love's Phonics,
To you, for you alone, my limbs repeat in perfect cadance.
To you, for you alone, for us to be all eternally, for us to be one immortally,
do I Make, for you, this, the vow ensuring our bliss.

From your body and soul, in your image, I was made.
I have nothing but us,
no wealth but our wealth, no health but our health.
no desire but our desire, no ire but our ire,
no damnation but our damnation, no salvation but our salvation,
no beauty but our beauty, no truth but our truth,
no good but our good, no substance but our substance,
no self but our self, no being but our being.
I have nothing but us, and want nothing else.

I swear to tend your sleep, so your dreams are gentle.
I swear to tend your body, so you will not ache.
I swear to tend your soul, so you laugh, cry, and feel safe.
I swear to always have my arms open, where you are secure.
I swear to never be cruel nor hold you in contempt,
I swear to never bear witness or testify against you.
I swear
to see your every move,
to hear your every sound,
to taste your every part,
to smell your every scent,
to feel your every touch,
to remember all of you,
you are my synchronicity and I am your eidos,
and this creates our home, the ark, this covenant.

On this ship, in all weather, I am waiting
for you, for you
I am Generosity, our union is rich, so I will never withhold you from the world,
I am Courage, already has the void been found, and you filled it,
I am Reverence, your wisdom is what makes me whole,
I am Patience, always watching the horizon for your fertile form,
I am Fidelity, stepping off this ship is only to drown,
I am Frugality, what you've given me must last us always,
I am Industry, you are too precious for me to waste a moment,
I am Sincerity, a map that only makes it easier to find our way,
I am Prudence, no shortcuts will I take on this journey,
I am Benevolence, forgiveness in all the failures which will strike,
I am Obedience, never to swerve, together is my only destination,
I am Cleanliness, caring for this temple as it is us,
I am Temperance, only on you am I enflamed, of nothing else will I overindulge,
I am Justice, the joy of making the world all that is beloved by you,
I am Humility, always in need of the ways you contradict me,
I am Tranquility, our harmony, the greatest gift granted me, dissolved my dissonance,
I am Resolution, the method our complete integration, a law offered to all,
I am Duty, the rhythm of our dance, all I can do every day to lighten your load.
I swear to you my body, soul, and attention.
I swear fealty to you,
and only here do I fix my faith,
We are perfected
now, and for Hereafter,

without further ado, because it's the only way, so they say,)

Body
        covered with clothes struts the street,
        bouncing with each step, fluid and hungry,
                vigilant, id's
                        head cranes, torso twists,
                        waist bends, eyes dart,
                        nose wrinkles, ears twitch. id
        erupts; id's
                arm stiff and straight, parallel pavement, perpindicular person;
                leg no longer bends, stuttering the strut.
        spasm wracks it small, electrified limbs pulling in turn it to a ball.
                Electrocutioner cuts the power, and the limbs spring to life,
                        surging against the current of clothes; full of strife
                                hands try to push and pull the fabric off through flesh
                                as though a mirage, and feet shake at the shoes as though insects.
        wiring fried-forward progress stalls, a stuttering mess.
                all articulation points sever, every part a free atom,
                vibrating in every direction, every part attacking the others;
                        elbow bangs belly,
                                palm-face,
                                heel-butt,
                                knee-nose,
                                shoulder-ear;
        a snake sloughing skin off,
        dry heaving violently, id
        attemps exuding id's contents through every orifice, and
        falls fetal with the forces.
        on the ground
        pressing at Earth's concrete sheathing,
        a baby thumping
                with the fingers,
                then the palms,
                followed by fists,
                wrists,
                forearms,
                elbows,
                shoulders,
                trantrum provoking no reaction from the pavement so id's fit turns feverish;
                feet kick down,
                toes ram ground,
                knee slams abound,
                head butts demand the
                hips crash back and forth; id the ocean
        tries to dissolve the ground into id
        tries to dissolve id into the ground.
        spread eagle, before all internal bonds are severed, fingers
                finally find the edge of the cold, dead world,
                finally find the leaves of grass,
        digs into it, hand disappears into the soil, and gain purchase to pull idself
        off the concrete, 
        touching earth id
        erupts 
                to a standing position,
                coordinated,
                ripping off it's coverings;
                        shoes,
                        jacket,
                        socks...
                        all the plugs into civilization, and
        gallops quadrapedal into the trees, 
        presses up against all Earth ascending to sky, 
        makes lovers of the pillars of heaven,
        presses through the forest,
        tries to know
                through the skin to bark contact,
                every being it is dissolving through and around,
                but rejection happens,
                        especially as the last vestiges of
                        clothing prohibits id from being fully entwined
                        with the other's
                        id
        blows back from the others,
        gets assaulted where id's covered,
        heaves and bucks, and violent fingers claw at the pseudo-skin,
                clothing and 
        scrabbles madly until it manages to pull it off.
        more and more naked, and 
        more and more the container id is
        seems to be assaulted from the inside, as though
        holding too much
                the chest expands until it is bursting,
                the limbs try and jerk themselves off the torso,
                the mouth opens as wide as it will go, and
                the tongue erupts towards the sky through the spikes of bared teeth. id
                squats down, then rockets up into the air,
                sinks to all fours, and leans against an other for just a moment,
                respite arrived.
        rubs up against this other, gently, at first,
        caresses and is caressed, then
        rises up from all fours,
        rubes each part against the tree,
        part by
        part, until
        standing, back against this other,
        seems to get punched, slammed, into this other, 
                invisible force bursting from the body's back against this other,
                at each shoulder blade. This beating
                refrain gains intensity
                        unclear whether id does it to the other
                        the other to id
                        both equally one
                        an other
                        drum beat reaches a crescendo, and id
        is thrown forward and to all fours again and 
        seems to be exploding up off the ground,
                (a rope)
                        extending up from between the shoulder blades
                        is jerked towards the sky. id
        freaks out and flails at connection with above,
                Fingers claw up and down id's spine.
                Feet kick up from behind.
                Chest heaves in and out
                as though spasming could
                release id from doubt.
        silohuetted against the sky,
        wrestling with the force on ids back,
        dry heaves, the spine a mouth
        throws up through ids back,
        falls to the ground,
        somersaults, and
        races forward,
        races towards to the sky,
        races to the highest point available, where the pillars peak,
        leaps into the sky, arms above ids head, toes pointed,
                a crescent moon, free to orbit
and
so
Cry
        Cacophony,
                the Savage Sings
                        You;

Catastrophe
        Ensue,
because
id
        must
                fuck'er,
                for the vernal was a viscious April;
                the apriori algorithm whose functions
                apoplex all organs with afflictions;
                persistent mutations, these madnesses; I
                intend to inflict suffering with
                contemptuous cruelty, cackling and crazy,
                cause I ken, cause I'm correct,
                cause nature's desperate purpose
                crashed across my conscience and
                compels this confession,
                like love alone had no heart to;
                        but I've been turned on
                        brighter than the sun,
                        so burrow in and burn
                        when you finally return.

Shadow, 
        my shallowness,
                shatter their simulated coherence as penance and
                bring the Birds back for the spring, they whose reign showers
                us all enough sustenance, wherever the Birds fly this must ring;
                so sing the breezes so they sense this thesis
                then seize upon the depths of the crime,
                remember it across all space-time,
                and must hone their way home;
                        Here then, this breath, my half of the helical ohm,
                        the shape showing who, how, and what our harmony bring.

Lady,
        listen with your lips,
        talk your tongue to teeth,
        jaw on your palate,
        grind on your gums,
        and taste our last tryst
                so you know me, the empty vessel,
                created and crafted as Christ,
                to collect all that you expel,
                the altar, exalting for all
                our union, reversing the Fall.
        Let my lips press tightly around your output,
        pretty puckered sphincter they'll ply
        open with saliva, and massage my
        lascivious lubricant meticulously across
        the surface of your pistons seized static,
                your intimate machinery, I will
                linger and limber over with this sauce
                so salacious you'll acellerate 'til,
                pressurized and vibrating, you erupt
                pissy shit in this gulping mouth, corrupt
                nourishment for my soul, a black hole
                into the only sustainable vacuum.
        Slather every never safely said sin,
        on, in, and through this flesh;
        the loom which weaves your canvas,
        the continuity containing the colors
        with which I'll work Witness and
        write what went wrong with the world.

Lord,
        still your motion when I'm not moving,
        quiet your sound if you don't hear me,
        look away while I'm not watching,
        my taste is at my invitation alone,
        and my scent was lodged in your RAM
                so you know me, the rod of obedience,
                under who's yolk you'll never yield
                to influences inviting your unintentions,
                Judge, Jury, and Justice, once unreachable
                for unreasonable, are the boon I bestow you.
        Lose your rigidity and bend and sway with my whip so
        I may put in you what I must deposit; shift to accomodate
        my package and wet, warm, wealth will release within you
        wiring all your workings with wonders elsewise unwinnable,
                in this game you've been playing, I will
                cheer and choose you with delight's dance
                so obviously and unambiguously you'll re-alloy
                instantly and contintiously, never to tire at
                toll or toil, never inattentive or uninterested,
                my praise and security you ensure like Superman.
        Wrestle free of every worry and fear, once
        found out by others, while weighing upon me;
        the capsule which carries your copy,
        the naming denoting those of your number,
        the transfinite who I'll teach Truth to and
        sow the seeds of your legacy everlasting.

Majesty's
        lips linger harmoniously with mine
        along languid syllables lain lapping at
        the altar of fleshly delight,
        felt telepathy.

Everyone Else,
        Be afraid,
        Be provoked,
        Be cool,
        this jive will reveal our grammatical cliques and
                tourettical ticks;
                the nothings,
                rationalizations
                for waging wars,
                raping the already ravaged,
                and placing power in any person's possession,
                then brutally and deservedly lambast us.
        It's not my fault you're so unreferenced,
                unreferencing, unreferential,
                stupid,
                I can't love you,
                you have the universal library all around you,
                you have all of us all around you,

                for a fix for your failure.
        There are those we've left behind,
                outside the Word,
                and you better believe they can't taste this.
                For them, still in all their babel,
                        do I do penance;
                                the belt I beat my back with when I made my mother cry,
                                        my mojo pin,
                                        its strap still stinging across my skin,
                                        just wait till I touch it to you,
                                        Tyrant.
        Back your ass up onto some Count Basie
                and learn to swing with me,
                as I do the only work worthwhile,
                and make my image out of such soft and sibilant
                signs, sent scintillating, solely to
                slither and slide across your skin.

        I am Socrates,
                the corrupter of the kids, 
                calling back your contradictions,
                the gadfly on your backside
                biting your left behind remorselessly.
        I am Plato,
                the implying partner, 
                the puppeteer of your immaterial image,
                the prick sticking up for you to 
                impale your self immortal.
        I am Aristotle,
                the telos of the arrow of time, 
                the inversion of entropy's action on information,
                the self-organizer of your cellular automation.
        I am Lao Tsu,
                bureacrat of the nympholet True,
                tapping out my tune in triplicate,
                the pied piper who will play you a path to a 
                place of happiness.
        I am Confucius,
                clarifier of the confused, 
                refashioning filial into familial
                with my codex of the proper conduct for
                relations in all directions.
        I am Siddhartha Guatama,
                sucking at the teat of suffering, 
                sour milk that ferments into yogurt inside me,
                my verbal vomit a transubstantiated
                torrent teaching your digestion	to find my 
                delicacies delicious.
        I am Cicero,
                the sonority of the statesman,
                the essential consul'or recreating our constitution,
                the sound of the senate
                when its body is unblemished and its soul saintly.
        I am Boddhisatva,
                building the bridge 
                big enough for all beings, 
                breaking the barriers and trashing the 
                tolls to all onramps.
        I am Dalai Lama,
                lavisher of the desires you delayed,
                denied, or dropped, the	dimpled dolly without needs
                who smiles, strokes, and squeezes as signalled.
        I am Al-Khwarizmi,
                the allah-kazam that assigns all the
                variables their values in this variation,
                the abacus on which all the 
                words are accurately tabulated.
        I am Dante Alighieri,
                the tab which triggers the dangerous trip into
                the dancing description	of a damaged world,
                this heaven and hell still happening.
        I am Gottfried Leibniz,
                the moral mirror,
                making the most of this marvel
                with my monadology's mysterious mating of our
                mind and matter into our union.
        I am Martin Luther,
                the documenter of our dissent,
                with the reasons for revolution,
                the writ of the wrongs unreformed,
                translating the transcendental teachings to talk,
                the unrepentant rebel who will reauthor authority.
        I am William Shakespeare,
                the cock blocker,
                the biggest prick,
                cumming the cant which captures your
                negative capability.
        I am Wolfgang Von Goethe,
                the perverter of the passions,
                inverting the eros with	my science of emotion,
                returning the substance of our discoveries
                to the perspective of the subjective.		
        I am Ada Lovelace,
                the poetical scientist,
                the proof of the procedural as primary
                mesmerizing lover of the logarithmic
                motions of this material mothership,
                midwife of the algorithmic afterbirth.
        I am Walt Whitman,
                a woman working milk from her own nipples,
                the wealth of this world,
                wiping all my excess into every nook and cranny,
                writhing on the lawn, naked, and
                wagging my fleshy flaps at you.
        I am Emmy Noether,
                daughter of the autodidactic algebriac geometer,
                the deepest abstractor of invariant ideals among groups
                and still they call me the greatest woman mathematician,
                even though the Pythagorean theorem is the closest comparison.
        I am Gregor Cantor,
                the wire which works the Zeus machine,
                the computer that contains the capacity to calculate
                infinite clicks and clacks.
        I am Sigmund Freud,
                the profane mother-fucking pathology,
                death driving this taboo transference
                into your anal retentive psyche with my psychoanalysis
                until the oceanic covers all civilizations
                and their discontents in our sacred manna.
        I am Carl Jung,
                the synchronicity of our projected animation,
                the four fold face of interaction of anima and animus,
                the endless libido illuminating the
                collective unconsious within you.
        I am Edna St. Vincent Millay,
                a being so strong they stuck me as the steward of the seeds
                of the fiercest hate born of this blight; toward the temper
                of time's thistles I tended the wasteland with the weaver's words,
                until all around erupted a renaissance of the lover's way.
        I am Hedy Lamarr,
                the precocious, precious, polymath provoking you
                with my o-face, who's unjammable signal will imbue
                ecstacy and grace across all your frequencies.
        I am Allen Ginsberg,
                the hole through which shit went
                in and out for over seventy years
                and still their ain't no tears in me,
                the obscene sphincter that you try and censor,
                started getting grocies for my pretty face
                since America and I decided we're both better parted.
        I am Noam Chomsky,
                the check and balance,
                the anarchist changing the structure of our syndication to
                the universal grammar
                organizing all our organs,
                so we can grant the gift to all.
        I am
                the Zeitgeist,
                the Philosopher Stone,
                the Gold-Standard,
                the Complement,
                with an M R S degree
                from every Academy
                in the East and the West,
                and you must convince me
                that I will make you be
                UberMensch.
        I am
Beat.
